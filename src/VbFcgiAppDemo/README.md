This is a demo FCGI application for the VbFcgi framework. Don't build your own DLL using this code (to avoid problems with CLSID collisions). Start a new/fresh ActiveX DLL project for your FCGI application instead!

After compiling your DLL, make a copy and change the extension from ".dll" to ".fcgi".
